# Google FooBar Challenges Compilation

Google Foobar has a lot of problems that can be fun, complicated and challenging, but they also are a very good coding practice.

Feel free to add your solutions and more challenges if you have (Just make sure that they are from Google Foobar and that they passsed all the test included hidden ones).
